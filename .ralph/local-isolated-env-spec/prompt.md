study .ralph/local-isolated-env-spec/spec.md
study .ralph/local-isolated-env-spec/progress.md and pick the most important thing to do. Only pick one task and complete it. DO NOT BE EAGER! just one task and return

NOTES:

- optionally update the spec or progress files if you feel changes need to be made. do not create new files with unimportant data.
- author new tests like the ones in examples/workflows and / or unit tests.
- update the progress file when the task is done
- when tests pass, commit and push

IMPORTANT:

- don't be eager with you modifications. stay focused on the task you chose.
- minimize the amount of text you read by utilizing e.g ripgrep.
- after push, stop and return control to user
- I AM NOT LISTENING TO YOU, DON'T ASK ME QUESTIONS

If all tasks are complete and there's no longer work to be done, write to me

ALL TASKS COMPLETE!

and exit
